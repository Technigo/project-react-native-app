# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

I here made a News headline using the free News API and fetched the data and displayed it on the screen.

In addition to Reactive Native I have also used Moment for the time view and Lottie for the splash animation.

The site works both in IOS and Webview.

## The problem

I have had problem with showing the Lottie animation on the web view but was able to solve it using the Platform dependency.
