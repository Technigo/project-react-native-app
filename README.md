# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is my first project in React Native. It's a simple weather App, that gets the users location and displays according weather data. As a special feature, the App fetches the weather data from random cities, when the user shakes the phone

## The problem

It was quite a struggle to get everything up and running with this project. Working with React Native and Expo dev for the first time, there were a lot of technical issues to be solved in the beginning. I also tried working with several APIs and ended up using Openweathermap for fetching the data according to my location. 
From there I developed the idea of displaying random weather on shake. 
For the shake-recognition I used the Accelerometer from expo sensors. When the shake is activated, I fetch again data from Openweathermap, but this time not with my actual location, but with geodata that I randomly choose from a geodata.json- file

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
