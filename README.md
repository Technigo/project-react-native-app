# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The assignment of the week was developing a React Native app to show data fetched from an API and provide opportunity for a user to interact with the app's content. 

## The problem

I have decided to develop a recipe app that uses Edaman API. I have started with a simple one page app that fecthes recipes based one search word received from the User's input. I have expanded the interaction further with adding several filteres to allow user to select recipes based on some dietary preferences.

After that expanded the app to show details of each recipe on a separate page and added stack navigation. 

To have more interaction with the user I have added a share button, that allows the user to share the recipe link.

I have then proceeded to expand functionality and developed a welcome and profile pages. The welcome page offers to ways to proceed: search for the recipes or look at profile. The profile page shows the recipes liked by the user. I used React Native asynchronous storage to store the "starred" recipes.
