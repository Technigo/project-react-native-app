# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

I created my own multipage exercise-app for horseback-riders. In the app the user could, depending on what type of training they would like, randomize different exercises within dressage or jumping. 

The app was built in React Native and was published in Expo. The learning objectives were to learn how to use React Native to create a mobile App and to practice using Styled Components for styling in JavaScript.

## The problem 

The biggest challenges this week were to get Expo to work properly and to understand how to translate things I have already written in React into React Native. Even though this project has been challenging I have enjoyed it a loot and looking forward to develop my app even further in the future.
