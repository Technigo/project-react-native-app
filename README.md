# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week we should build a mobile app. 
We had one week to be done with the assignment and learn all the new tools used. 

## The problem
I found an API that I wanted to use. I used styled components and had a button with TouchableOpacity to generate the technical quotes from the API.  

## View it live
You can see the app here:
