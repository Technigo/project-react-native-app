# Project React Native App üì±
This weeks project was to create an App with React native.

## The problem

First of, I had an insane amount of tecnichal problems. Almost everything had to be updated or replaced or reinstalled. Ater a whole day of that I still coulden't get th expo app to function so I built the app in Snack instead. 
Second I tried to do something waaay to advanced for me (building a game with react-game-engine). That also took up quite some time. 
So mainly I've been wasting a lot of time this week.. ü§∑‚Äç
However it was fun trying to build the game because I felt like I got to explore a lot, even if I did not end up using much of that knowledge in the finished project..
