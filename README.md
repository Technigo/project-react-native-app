# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This weeks project was working with React Native, i wanted to focus mostly on learning as much as possible about how some areas worked, rather than creating a conceptually interesting app. I "translated" the functionality of last weeks movies project to React Native. The areas i focused on were:
- implementing React Navigation to be able to move and pass props between several screens
- working with styled components
- importing custom fonts with expo-fonts
- implementing API-fetch, useState and useEffect 

My experience is that it is a bit of a threshold getting started with React Native, it is like everything works a little bit different than it does in React, and the error messages and feedback from the system is a bit more fuzzy. There has been a lot of head-scratching and i have gotten stuck on a lot of things but ive been able to solve most of the issues. And slowly I've started becoming really fond of working with React Native, so i hope to be able to continue digging here. 

I tried putting the entire repo as a "snack" on expo, but it seems like snack doesn't work with styled components? At least that is the error messages I'm getting.

I have also expo-published the app:

If i had more time i would have
- Made the app look nicer and added more features
- Implemented something that interacts with the sensors on the phone
- Worked more with state and props to understand that better, perhaps by making an expanding menu or nav bar
- Implement inputs and interactivity

Anyway, super fun week and I learned lots!
