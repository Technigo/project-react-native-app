# Project React Native App 📱

A Quiz app about "The Office" built in React Native 🤓🔥🍻🤳

## Code
I've used:
  * **React Native**
  * **JavaScript**
  * **Styled Components**
  * **CSS**

## The problem

Started out with the layout of the form to have one question with different answers to chose from per screen. If-statments to show the right question and then functions that will handle the answers. I've had a hard time structuring without losing some info on the way - which means that all of my code is in the App.js file, unfortunately. Overall happy with the result and the the fact that I completley understand the code I've written.
