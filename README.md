# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This space-app shows a picture from NASA Open API ( https://api.nasa.gov/) and everyday there is a new photo with an explanation. 

## The problem

I used styled-components for styling and expo.io for debugging. If I had more time i would separate the section with text-information and open it with onPress to navigate to a new screen.
