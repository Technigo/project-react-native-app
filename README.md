# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The assignment was to build an application for mobile using React Native. 

## The problem

I struggled a lot with this week's assignment ðŸ¤¯ I had a lot of issues downloading all dependencies. And along came the issues with understanding React NativeðŸ˜… After trying different approaches to fulfill the minimum requirements I ended up doing a multiscreen app using React Drawer Navigation. Tech that I used:

- React Drawer Navigator containing 2 different items, Home and TodoList.
- useState hook, allowing the user to add information on Home.
- useEffect hook, to render every time the state changes.
- navigation.navigate() and route.params to pass data between screens
- Styled Components

If I had more time I would read up more on Styled Components and passing props, since it felt like I just repeated a lot of code.
