# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
In this week's project, I have built my first mobile application with React Native! It was super useful but first I struggled with the creativity part of the project.

## The problem
In VS Code my animation did not work and I could not figure it out why. So I had to step back and look out my project from outside. Then I have just built it in expo and worked!
