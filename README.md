# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

A project created in Technigo frontend development boot camp.

The objective was to get to know React Native and explore the possibilities, and the tools and workflows needed for production and creation. Also a practice in using styled components.

## The problem

A lot of new tools, techniques and concepts to grasp in a short period of time, so I focused on the basics and to try out a few things. I choose to follow a tutorial involving using a permission request and the sharing function. I also worked with the styled components to get an understanding of the logic and concept. 

If I had more time I would start over and try to build something of my own with other sensors and also try out navigation. 

In this app I would try to add a "Share another image" function.
