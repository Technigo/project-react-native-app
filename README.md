# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project, I have built my first mobile application with React Native!

## What I have learnt

- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practice using Styled Components for my styling.

## The process and structure

I hope I have reached the **BLUE LEVEL** ðŸ”µ

This week I think it has been tough but at the same time cool that I built an app. Difficult to grasp the different components for react-native and get styling with Styled Components.

I decided early to keep my app simple and it's similiar to the Magic Eightball. My app is called "The App of Answers". Got questions? All you have to do is ask... shake your phone and get an answer!

The answer is random selected from my file answers.json where I keep a bunch of answers.

For the shake function I took inspiration from Ragna Ãšlfars repo on Github [https://github.com/Ragtulf/project-react-native-app](https://github.com/Ragtulf/project-react-native-app)
