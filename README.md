# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Project making my first Mobile App with React Native.

## The problem

So after watching code-along on how to use the phones accelerometer and drawer navigation I decided to do a random animal shaker that shows random pictures of animals when phone i shaken enough.
Used API's for fetching images: -https://aws.random.cat/meow -https://random.dog/woof.json -https://randomfox.ca/floof/

Added vibration for when new animals was generated, icons for drawer navigation, some fonts and a frontpage.

I spent too much time trying to add custom .svg icons for the drawer that didn't work out. Also tried to add more API's that hade diffrent fetch methods but ran out of time. Also tried to add Lottie animation but also didn't work out so resorted to a .gif.
If I had more time I would've wanted to make theese work.
