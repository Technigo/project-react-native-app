# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The aim was to make a functioning app with react-native. I decided to make an app that fetched breeds from an api and displayed information and an image of each particular breed.

## The problem

I found working with the tools that displayed the app on the phone during the development frutrating and time-consuming.  Other than that this was a fun project. I had problems fetching the images that came from a separate api, but it worked out in the end. If I had more time I would style the app differently and add more information.
