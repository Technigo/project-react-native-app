# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

A React Native mobile application fetching and displaying dad jokes from an API, where you can generate new random jokes, search for jokes and share jokes with your friends.

## The problem

I started looking up fun free API's and found a straight-forward API to work with. The main idea was to randomly display something from an API, and then have a button to generate a new random whatever, which ended up to be a joke in this case. After elaborating around what I could do with the data and API endpoints, I implemented some interaction to the application - a search field and share function.

Not deployed, might deploy later on Expo.
