# Project Dont Drop Your Phone ðŸ“±

This app was built with the purpose of practice to use React Native and Styled Components, with the focus point of using the Accelerometer. It's a simple game where you have to shake your phone as hard and long as possible to gain points.

## The problem

The project was built by using Technigo's template "react-native-app" and the brach "shake-sensor" where some code for the accelerometer already was pre-written and packages ready to install. I also installed expo and other dependencies. I worked in the SensorComponent and started with the different shake alerts. I tried to do some better logic for them but I couldn't get that to work properly and was running out of time, so I did a simpler but less satisfying solution. Then I made the score counter. I ran in some problems to get it to work properly but I got some great help from a team mate to solve it. The plan was to give the user more points for when higher thresholds were reached but as for now, there's only points for the highest threshold. I might come back to fix this later when I have more time. I ran into some errors and needed to debug things, and I found most of the solutions by Googling, or look at how others solved their problems in Slack.

If I had more time I would like to add a home screen with a logo, short rules and a start button. I tried to do that but had some problems with installing and running the packages needed, so I have to come back to it later. I also would like to have a high score list.
