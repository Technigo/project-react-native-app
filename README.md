# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project is Weather App for mobile.

## The problem

In this project I used Styled components, JS, React Native, React, NPM and Expo. This is my first multi-page site using React Native. I used npm and expo to instal some libraries that were needed for my project like lottie, moment and expo-sensors. When I had problems I used google and stackoverflow.
