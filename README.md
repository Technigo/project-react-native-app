# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is a book finder app built in React Native. It takes a key word, entered by the user, and fetches data from Google book API based on the users search term.
The app then randomly selects a book from the list of answers provided by the API.


## The problem

The response from the API was a bit limited and didn't support my first plan to for example, find a book after category or sort books by rating. I found another API, Goodreads, with more information and better rating count. But they don't provide a json respons so I used Google anyway and ajusted the app to what I could do with that.

The hardest part with this weeks project was to troubleshoot, since the error messages are not always very clear. But I also spent some time with styling and the rating stars. 

If I had more time I would make a save-list where you could save and rate your favourite books. Maybe also a link to a library or a book store, if you want to read the book.
