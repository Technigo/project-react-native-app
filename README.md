Project 14 a React Native App ðŸ“± during Technigo boot camp

In this week's project we were building our first mobile application with React Native.

Requirements were to use Styled Components.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started off with a stopwatch tutorial to follow and then I have changed the stylesheet styling to styled.components.
I'm still working on the project to change the code to hooks, if I would have had more time to focuse on the project I would probably have started over and also investigated in React-Stopwatch.
