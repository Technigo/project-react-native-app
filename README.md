# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This was a project I did while attending Technigos 24 week frontend bootcamp. We where supposed to build our first mobile application with React Native and using styled components.


## The problem

Biggest problem for me was how slow the updates showed up in the developer server and how hard it was to understand the error messages, and how to fix them.

## View it live

Sorry, this project canÂ´t be seen live.
