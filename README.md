# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I made an app with the work title Rembrant Randomizer, using React Native and an API fetch from Rijksmuseum, Netherlands. For this app I used React Native Navigation, styled components and expo sensors. 

## The problem

This week was an interesting challenge since I have never done an app before! It took me some time to figure out what approaches would suit me and the project best. When I get more time I will add an loader and also display for info on each artwork.
