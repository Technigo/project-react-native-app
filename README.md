# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

We were to create an app using React Native using 1 of three "methods": API-call, navigation or sensor. I chose to use API-call and navigation to create an displaying Cards and then further details of the cards when clicking them.

## The problem

At first there was a lot of research as we weren't given much to go on this week. We had to both make new software (expo) work as well as learning Native. I didn't plan much this week, it was more trial and error and lot of help from friends and colleagues. If I had more time I would have liked to have spent more time on styling and trying more advanced methods in the actual screens. Now getting the shell in place of navigation was so hard that not much time was left for other things.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
