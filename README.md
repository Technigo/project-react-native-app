# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is a Car application made with react native and react navigation to display different cars at certain prices.

## The problem

The problem this week was the lack of time that I had making this application. 
I started with creating a skiss for my project and during that process i decided to go for multipage app using React Navigation. The home page has a name of the application. And the other screens are different cars, the screens display a image of the cars + the cars name and starting price.
