# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

[Week #13 at Technigo Bootcamp]

In this week's project, I have built my first mobile application with React Native.

I created a giphy app, which gives you a random giphy video when you select a button tag / emotion.
And the giphys are easy to copy and share with your friends.
