# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is my first react native app. In this app I have used an API to fetch meal recipes based on the provided ingredient. Drawer Navigation is used to provide user option to search the recipes for some different ingredient. User can watch the video of recipe by pressing on the name of of the recipe.

## The problem

There were some issues with the dependencies versions because of expo. However i was able to solve them through the react-native and expo documentation.
