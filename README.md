# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

First React Native app.

## The problem

I used Android Studio to create an emulator to see my app. I started by designing two questions and fixing all the issues with the score that arose, for example the user could go back and click the correct answer several times before I added the local state of user answer which prevent that from happening. The problem was that the state reloads if you don't move to the next question, if I had more time I could make the state global and fix that.
