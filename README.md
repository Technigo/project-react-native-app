# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I've made a React Native App showing 20 top rated films as a weekly project for Technigo Frontend Bootcamp, using API from themoviedb.org. The goal was to practice using React Native and working with their documentation. 

## The problem

I wasn't sure how to use API and parameters in React Native. I took it up to a open classroom session, which cleared out the confusion. The solution was ;
- to define the parameter as { parameter name that I want to use } = route.params 
- navigate ('page name', { parameter name that I want to use : json that I'm using })

## View it live
