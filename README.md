# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project build my first mobile application with React Native.

## The problem

This week's project is a very free one. My only restrictions is that it should be a mobile app created with React Native and using styled components. And I am choosing to create a magic 8-ball. I use the same random selector that we used in the cluedo game.

I think it was really hard to use style-component, but also really fun.
