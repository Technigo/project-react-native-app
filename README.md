# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this project I created a mobile app using react Native.


## The problem

I chose to use an external API in my app and fetch and display data from it. I used the Accelometer from expo sensors which detects the phones movement. The movement of the phone (passing a certain threshold) activates the function which fetches new data from the API. I also added a vibration effect which activates on every new render.

I added a loader from the Lottie files and used switch statement to render different images depending on the content of the data.
