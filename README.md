# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project's goal was a very ambitious one: to get *our very first React Native app* up and running in just a week. 

## The problem 
We were given three branches to choose from: APIs & sharing, Multiscreen navigation and sensors. There and here was also the posibility to combine them. 
My app is a Random Advice Giver. It fetches a random advice from the API https://api.adviceslip.com/ (first endpoint), in the HomeScreen, and retrieves a text which can be shared on social media or private, messages, emails, etc by using the "share" button below.
On a first approach I wanted to do the APIs and sharing, and combine it with multiscreen navigation as well, because I think that is a very required feature. Although in theory I know what I need to use in order to implement those functionalities, one week is a very short time to get everybody set up without a clear model to follow, so I'm finally setting for the sharing functionality only so as to cover the blue level requirements for this project. But I'll definitely continue to explore React navtive by building more apps. 


## What I learned ðŸ’¡

React Native offers so many cool posibilities! I want to try everything and dig deeper into it. Styled components is a very convenient way to include css in JavaScript. I also found out that it's possible to build cross patform mobile apps (iOS and Android). I also learned how to code an app and handle the view and debugging directly from my phone or through Android Developer Studio.
