# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

A mobile app created with React native. 
The app gives you random gin&tonic recipe from Edamam API. 

## The problem

I had some issues wiht the expo go developer app in shake sensor branch. So I had to redo my project in the end of the week and just go with API calls. 
I managed to merge the shake sensor with my api call last day, but got some issues that crashed the app after a few seconds. So I took one step back and just went with a button instead of 
shake. 
I also planed to add Lottie animation but Lottie wouldent work with our version of dependencis (we think..).
