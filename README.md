# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Project week 13 @ Technigo Bootcamp we were supposed to build our first mobile application with React Native! I went for a step counter app, mainly because I thought it would be fun to use one of the functionalities in the phone, in this case the Pedometer.

## What I learned

- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practicing using Styled Components
- More practice in useState and useEffect

## Technologies used

- JavaScript ES6
- React Native
- Styled Components

## View it live
