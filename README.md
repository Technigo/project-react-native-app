# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Task to create an app in React Native. Due to stressful week I went very basic and createad a step counter by using sensor "Pedometer". 

## The problem

Challenging to understand what libraries and dependencies to use. Had problems in the begining to even start the project due to technical issues. If I would have had more time this week I would have put more energy into styling and make the app a bit more complex.
