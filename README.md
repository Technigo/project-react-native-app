# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
Loved this project. Wished that there was more time to make it a bit more real... and useful. 
Watched a lot of tutorials that helped med a lot. 

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
A bit hard to grasp the expo thing. A lot of errors, and had to start over every five minutes. 
Would be good to have known that if you have an apple device, you CAN not open someone elses expo-link. 
Would have saved some time ðŸ˜…
But, I think I have learned a lot this week!
