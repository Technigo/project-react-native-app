# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

I created an app in React native practicing using the mobile sensors, APIÂ´s and drawer navigation. The app can render a random quote with either a button or when you shake your mobile. 

## The problem

I used styled components and added a hamburger menu to switvh between the button- and the shake-version.
