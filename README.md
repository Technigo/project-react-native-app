# Week 16: Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week's project was to build a first mobile app using react Native.

## The problem

I decided at the beginning to explore all options: sensors, fetch an external API, navigation. Since I got it right quite fast, I decided to combine everything in my project. I used different APIs to fetch cat images and I made three screens with tab navigation: one where the user can design their own meme, one where the user has to shake enough in order to get a nice picture, and finally a game where hitting a target is rewarded with a gif. All results can be shared. I added some details also: vibration when picture is fetched, status bar hidden when result is displayed, open external url.

I styled it quite simply, I wanted it to look clean and almost professional, even if the subject isn't (cat pictures). I am really proud of what I achieved to do.

It wasn't a difficult project in itself, but dealing with Expo was a bit challenging.

If I had more time, I would have explored DeviceMotion instead of Accelerometer for the game and I would have added many positions for the target.
