# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This weeks project was to create a React Native app. There were three different bransches to choose from, and I decided to work with API.

## The problem

This week was quite hectic, for several reasons. There were a lot of things to install to be able to work on the project, and once it was installed, it was time to familarize with React Native tutorials and documentation. There were not much hands-on details given this week, so it was a lot of trial and error to get things working. 

I started with styling components, which I found both fun and quite logic. Making the fetch followed the same structure as when working with React, but it still took some time to grasp the idea. Understanding how to share something was a bit of a struggle, and it took a lot of googling before I found any useful sources. 

If I had more time, I would also dive into navigation between several screens in React native, and learn more about how to share selected things from an API. I find React Native fun but very challenging, and I wish there were more time to dive into this.
