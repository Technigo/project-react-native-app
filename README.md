# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project was made by me on the 13th week of the Technigo bootcamp. 
The assigment was to to an app on React Native and to use style components, since we are used to style with CSS atm. 

## The problem

I think that I'm a bit use of technology lagging and crashing, that React native didn't bother me that much. I think my greatest problem started in the beggining with the whole expo-setup. 
After that it went pretty smooth. The biggest AHA-moments for me was used <View> then all of my coding worked. I still don't totally understand style components fully, but I'm starting to grasp how to use it. 
Hopefully by the time somebody is reading this, I was able to fix my textinput to my API and that once entering a city in the <TextInput> the API will read the salons in the city mentioned. ATM the APP is fixed set on Stockholm and my <TextInput> is of no use. 
If I had more time I would also set up a dropdown to sort the salons, by name or ratings.
