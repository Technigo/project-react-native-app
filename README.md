# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This weeks project was working with React Native, i wanted to focus mostly on learning as much as possible about how some areas worked, rather than creating a conceptually interesting app. I "translated" the functionality of last weeks movies project to React Native. The areas i focused on were:
- implementing React Navigation to be able to move and pass props between several screens
- working with styled components
- importing custom fonts with the help of expo-fonts
- implementing API-fetch, useState and useEffect 

My experience is that it is a bit of a threshold getting started with React Native, it is like everything works a little bit different than it does in React, and the error messages and feedback from the system is a bit more fuzzy. There has been a lot of head-scratching and i have gotten stuck on a lot of things but ive been able to solve most of the issues. And slowly I've started becoming really fond of working with React Native, so i hope to be able to continue digging there.
