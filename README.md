# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project's goal was a very ambitious one: to get *our very first React Native app* up and running in just a week. 

## The problem 
We were given three branches to choose from: APIs & sharing, Multiscreen navigation and sensors. There and here was also the posibility to combine them. On a first approach I wanted to do the APIs and sharing, and combine it with multiscreen navigation as well, because I think that is a very required feature. Although In theory I know what I need to use in order to implement those functionalities, one week is a very short time to get everybody set up without a clear model to follow, so I'm finally setting for the sharing functionality only. 


## What I learned ðŸ’¡

React Native offers so many cool posibilities! I want to try everything and dig deeper into it. Styled components is a very convenient way to include css in JavaScript. I also found out that it's possible to build cross patform mobile apps (iOS and Android). I also learned how to code an app and handle the view and debugging directly from my phone or through Android Developer Studio.
