# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

I started with reading the brief closely to make sure I understood what the goal and requirements were for this project. I then did some research on react native and basic apps to build. After that I sketched a design and user flow. Then I did some more research into how to work with api:s in react native. 

Then I stared to code - I had an idea on what was needed to achieve my goal. I came quite far before I ran into a dead-end. At this time I turned to googleing and to reach out to get help. I did get help and that help pointed me in several directions and I ended up with a code that was built from bits and pieces from all over. Not ideal. And still warnings and errors. Eventually I was helped with scaling down my code and making it a lot cleaner (and with no errors) than I had done. 

Main learning this week: it was tricky to take my knowledge of js, css, and html and put it to use in react native. I had lots of warnings and errors along the way. Also building for different devices was hard. But I also really enjoyed it. There is something very satisfying in viewing and interacting with your results on a mobile. I can definitely see myself learning more about react native - and having fun doing it.
