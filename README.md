# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This weeks project was to create an app with React Native and to make use of one of the build in sensors. 

## The problem

The beginning of this project was rough, first I had the incorrect version of React and could not update it regardelss of what I tried, I choose to reinstall and do expo install instead of npm install which helped me solve 1 problem. The second problem I had was once the app was created, the sensors on my phone was not working, I had to reinstall and it worked after that. 

I used React Native, Snack, Expo, Styled components for this project.
