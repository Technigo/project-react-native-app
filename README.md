# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week's project was to build our first mobile app in React Native.
We had three focus areas to choose between, I worked with "Sensors" and built a step counter.
I also for the first time worked with React natives style components.

## The problem

Working with React Native has been very different from what we have done before.
I learned that you need to use a lot of dependencies to make it work, write the styling differently
and only focus on the output in a mobile.
In this bootcamp we only have this project with React native but
It has been fun and challenging, I think this is something I would like to explore more.
I have done some research and find it very inspiring with all the things you could build.

## View it live

This project is using expo go and can unfortunately only be viewed in android
