# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is my first React Native App! It is a mystic 8 ball, giving you random advice when you shake your phone. 

## The problem

When I had decided on what kind of app to make I started by sketching the app and making the randomizer work by pressing a button. The advice is mounted in a modal. Then I wanted a shake event, I googled and found someones code on a shake event. Then I checked some other student's projects on how they had used it tou figure out how to incoporate it in my structure. 
If I had had more time I would have like to make it looked prettier and structured it into more components.
