# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

## The problem

The assignment was to build an app i React Native and style it. I decided to go woth the shake-funktion (accelerometer), but decided also to implement functionalities we learned during the week.
The result is a quote-generator with two pages. You can navigate with a drawer. One page is updated when you shake the phone, and the other page is updated via a touchable opacity-button. Both fetches random quotes from api's.
I have styled it with styled component.

I had a compleatly different idÃ©a from the beginning (personalized dinner-eightball), but decided to keep that idea for a future hoby project. I had help from this weeks labs when I styled my project, but if I had more time I would use more resuable components in my app.

I am very pleased that I have kept my cool, despite the code having millions of warnings this week. I have searched for solutions and made it work. I plan to go through my code and make more comments in order to remember it better.
