# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
In this project, we focused on building a mobile application by using React Native, Expo and open API from https://open-api.myhelsinki.fi/doc?fbclid=IwAR1PJftf7OCTCNYjJy3z6H2QrhuFdzuKn89SAuMTDmTQxUeC19zza9YPmRU#/

## The problem


React Native and Expo were new concepts for me, and I found it pretty interesting and challenging to learn. First, I made a plan what type of sections, elements I wanted to have.It includes list of Helsinki's activities (data from API), image slider using ScrollView from react native, navigation function to access to multiple pages with a button to go back by using React Native Navigation, sharing function using Expo Share.

I tried to implement AsyncStorage and function to save and display saved activities. However my storage gets empty after I refresh the page. That is something I aim to look back and try to solve it.
