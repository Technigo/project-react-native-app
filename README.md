# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The project brief was open-ended, so I chose to focus on building an app that fetches some information and displays it to the user in a nice way. The main purpose of pursuing this focus area was to explore the differences between React Native and React for the web, including:
- Fetching information from different API endpoints using The Guardian's open API
- Displaying the data as a flatlist for better performance
- Conditionally rendering a "back to top" button based on what the user is viewing that scrolls to top with animation
- Adding functionality to open up recipes in the web browser in app
- Styling with Styled Components including with props to style based on selection

## View it live
