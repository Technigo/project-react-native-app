# Project React Native App 📱
This week was to create our own app using React Native and practice on styling using StyleSheet.

## The problem

For this project I did a magic 8-ball concept. I used an array of different answers and when shaking the phone the answers are displayed randomly in the screen. This is achieved by importing Accelerometer from expo-sensor. By installing Expo Go we could see changes on both browser and cellphone but most importantly try the Accelerometer on the phone.   

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
