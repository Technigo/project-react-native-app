# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

For this week's project I build my first mobile application with React Native, using an external API to fetch random dogs. The app can be shared and the styling is done using Styled Components. 

## The problem

I had a hard time getting different APIs to work and in the end I found a random dog API that worked. If I had more time I would add a lottie animation and also navigation to different routes.
