# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This week we tested out some React Native and build our first mobile app.


## The problem
I started by fetching the joke from the API and adding the Accelerometer so that the user gets another joke when shaking the mobile. Then I styled with styled-component.
If I had more time I would like to add menu and user can choose click option or shake option.
