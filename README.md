# Project React Native App 📱

The restrictions for this week was to create a mobile app with React Native, by using styled components and either use:

One the sensors from the mobile phone (such as the camera, accelerometer or voice assistance)

An external API to fetch something to the app and interact with it.

A multiscreen app by using React Navigation.

A useful app. 

## The problem

I created a minimalistic step counter, which also contains suggestions of how to gain more steps. I learned how to use React Native to create a mobile app, how to install and import packages like expo-sensors for the Pedometer which I used, and how to use styled components. 

## View it live
