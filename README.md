# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I have created my first mobile app with React Native. I choose the focus area sensor.
The app I have created let you shake your phone and a dad joke shows.

## The problem

The biggest problem this week was to get all the installments working but after that got sorted out I had a fun week building my app. If I had more time I would do so it fetches the jokes from an API insted.
