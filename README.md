# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This project was about building aan app in React Native, using styled components. I chose to build a todo-app, where you can delete and add todos.

## The problem
I started by adding som static todos and styled them , to see what they look like on the screen. Then I added an input field where The user can add new todos. After that I also added a function that deletes a chosen task whenpressing a button next to it.
