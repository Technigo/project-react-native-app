# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Assignment was to creact a native mobile app with the use of React Native. I chose to create a very simple barcode scanner app that takes the barcode and fetches data from an API

## The problem

Used the pre-made barcodescanner component from expo together with the openfoodfacts (www.openfoodfacts.com) API.
