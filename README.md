# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

I've built a react native App for cryptocurrencies with APIs, shaking sensor and navigation. It fetches the currencies and displays them all in a scrollview. There is also buy and sell buttons that will increase or decrease the money in your purse.
You can also get random currency info by either pressing a button or shaking the phone.


## The problem

I spent a looot of time on probably unneccessary things like adding custom fonts.
