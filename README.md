## The problem

Challenges:

- Fetching from the API, tested with different APIs
- Rendering the list of fetched characters as a FlatList
- Scrolling to the end of the page. Solved by adding a ListFooterComponent.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
