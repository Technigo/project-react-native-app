# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Building my first mobile application with React Native!
Goal:
- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practice using Styled Components for styling.

## The problem

I started off by choosing one of the three projects for the week. The lucky on was the Shake sensor.


## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
