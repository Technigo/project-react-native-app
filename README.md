# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this weeks project I had the chance to test out some React Native and build my first mobile app.

## The problem

This weeks project and approach was different from the other react weeks. It was exciting to build my very own mobile app. I choose to build a step counter!

The hardest part this week was the expo go and all the new error message that come along with that page and app! 
I solved it with the help of townhall session, stackOverflow and friends in the bootcamp.
