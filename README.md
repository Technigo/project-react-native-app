# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

I started with reading the brief closely to make sure I understood what the goal and requirements were for this project. I then did some research on react native and basic apps to build. After that I sketched a design and user flow. Then did some more research into how to work with api:s in react native.
