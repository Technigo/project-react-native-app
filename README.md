# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I made my first React Native App.

## The problem

By utilizing the knowledge we gained from this weeks live sessions I was able to implement all functions that were needed. I then took the time to play around with stylsheet stying, adding styled compontents and also trying out new different React Native Core Components.

If I had more time I would have made a fortune Cookie shaker. But I could not find a Api that left me disply the respons from my api request.
