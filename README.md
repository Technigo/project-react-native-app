# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is an app where you can look at random zoo animals. It fetches an image and som facts about a random animal from the API https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com/ .

To fetch a new animal just swipe down.

You can save animals you love and watch them again in the Loved tab.

I have used React Native Navigation for the tabs at the bottom.
