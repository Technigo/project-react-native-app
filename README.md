# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This project assignment was to build a mobile application with React Native, using styled components and a chosen focus areas.

I chose the focus area of sensors and the accelerometer. I made an app with a magic 8-ball, that shows different answers after shaking the phone. The code is split up into four different components. The sensor-component detects movement of the phone and stores a randomized answer from an array in the state. A different design is shown when shaking the phone.
