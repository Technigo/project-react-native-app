# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This week was to create our own app using React Native and practice on styling using StyleSheet.

## The problem

For this project I did a magic 8-ball concept. I used an array of different answers and when shaking the phone the answers are displayed randomly in the screen. This is achieved by importing Accelerometer from expo-sensor. By installing Expo Go we could see changes on both browser and cellphone but most importantly try the Accelerometer on the phone.
