# React Native App

A simple To-Do app created with React Native.

## Approach

The app is split up in three components, each of those using Styled Components. Adding a new item is handled with State. Items are added to a FlatList & being removed on click. 

## To-Do

- Clear input after submit
- Add specific delete button to each item
- When item is clicked, different styling should be applied to indicate it's been completed
