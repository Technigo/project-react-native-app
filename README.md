# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This weeks assignment was to build an app using React native. The app should either use one of the sensors, an external API, be multiscreen or an useful app.

## The problem
I found this week difficult since I still feel unsure and quite confused by some of the technologies (useState, Math for example). But I think it was fun to build an app and the little I know about React Native I like. I have designed it for iOS only (but it looks ok in the browser as well). If I had more time I would have made the button at a fixed height. So that it won't jump up and down depending on the height of the textblock that appears when clicking the button.
