# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I have created an app in React native. Shake your phone to get random pictures of foxes. 

## The problem

In the app I display three pages using navigation and I fetch random pictures of foxes using an API. To get a new picture you should shake your phone. The app also displayes Lottie animations. I started with planning what my app should include and how I wanted it to look. If I had more time I would have put more useful information in the app.
