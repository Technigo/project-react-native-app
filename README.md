# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

As part of week 13 of the TECHNIGO front end web development Boot Camp the assignment was to build our very first mobile application with React Native.

## The problem

For this brief we were given a lot of freedom - both in terms of the actual task, concept and styling. I had an unusually hard time coming up with an idea for my project. Eventually I ended up combining a Drawer Navigation set up with a couple of API call creating a tongue in cheek "Self Help App". The app is however not very helpful at all. The basic structure was to call a couple of silly API's and use them in the drawers of the navigation bar, displaying 3 options for some kind of self help. You could either get a quite useless life advise, a random generator giving you a "Yes" or "No" answer if you have a hard time making a decision - or simply choose to get cheered up by a Chuck Norris joke (usually not that funny).

I have really liked working with React Native, and wish we would get more time to experiment with yet another project or two. Due to lack of time I feel this project still in incomplete, and there are things IÂ´d like to improve. For instance IÂ´d like for the components to refresh with a new message from the API if you go back to the menu and then click into the drawer section once more. That is currently not the case. IÂ´d also like to do some reconstruction, such as making the Back Button into a separate component.

It was a completely new way of working with styling using Styled Components, a bit tricky at first but once I got the hang of it I enjoyed it for most parts. It was also our very first time working with Expo.io, I thought it was really cool to have my mobile screen instantly update with the code I wrote in VS.
