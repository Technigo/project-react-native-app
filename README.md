# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

## The problem

The assignment was to build an app i React Native and style it. I decided to go woth the shake-funktion (accelerometer), mbut decided also to implement functionalities we learned during the week. The result is a quote-generator with two pages. You can navigate with a drawer. One page is updated when you shake the phone, and the other page is updated via a touchable opacity-button. Both fetches random quotes from api's.
I have styled it with styled component.

I had a compleatly different idÃ©a from the beginning. I wanted to make a personalized dinner-eightball, but as the week went by i decided to go with API's we used in class. I had help from this weeks labs when I styled my project, but if I had more time I would use more resuable components in my app. I would also add a loading indicator. The code is prepared, but I havent dot the compnent yet.

I am very pleased that I have kept my cool, despit the code having millions of warnings this week. I have searched for soultions and made it work. I plan to go through my code and make more comments in order to remember it better.
