# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is my first project using React Native, yay! ðŸ¥³

## The problem

I chose to follow our learning material for this week and create an app using an external API to fetch random quotes. These quotes are handed the user by either shaking the phone (using the Accelerometer for this) or clicking a button (using core component Touchable Opacity). This week was fun and I think we have been introduced to React Native in a good way. I can't wait to explore it even further! :) If I had more time I think I would have tried out a few more core components and also fetching data from another API.
