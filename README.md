# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project, I built my first mobile application with React Native!
Focusing on
- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practice using Styled Components for your styling.

I Chose Focus Area: Multiscreen / Navigation

## The problem

- Create a drawer navigator containing at least 3 different items (Home, Profile, Logout)
- Allow the user to change some information on Profile
- Store that information in state
- Display the information on Home
- Clear the state when the user goes to the Logout page

I had a clear idea of what to do but couldn't in the end pass the params from one screen to the other. Tried several approches, with routes, otherParams, FlatList...
