# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This was my first React native project. I decided to build a classic Tic Tac Toe game with React Hooks and Styled Components. The game has a basic start page with a button that leads to the main game. The game itself calculates turns and who won. 

## The problem

This game needs some improvement such as reloading the game when a Winner is available. 

## View it live

The game is not yet deployed.
