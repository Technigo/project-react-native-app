This week's project is a very free one. Your only restrictions are that it should be a mobile app created with React Native, using styled components and have one functionality that uses the sensors of your mobile phone. (camera, gyro, accelerometer, voice assistance, ARKit etc.)

## Ideas that you could build 💡
- step counter
- photo booth
- some kind of game based on shakes/tilts on the phone 
- camera app
- a bubble level
- Or maybe you remember [this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT9gxQkSCN8&feature=youtu.be)!?
