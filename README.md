# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is an little "PopUp Popcorn Gallery", showing photos by the artist Aldis Ellertsdottir.

The app uses shake sensor to randomly flipp through the photos. It also has vibration when you shake the phone.

## The problem

I had problems with the layout. It took long time before I understood that the images was actualy there, I could not just see them. It was also lots of problem setting up Expo.
