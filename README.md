# Project React Native App - Wildlife photos 📱

This week I built my first mobile application with React Native!

This project was a very free one. Your only restrictions where that it should be a mobile app created with React Native and using styled components. Also, the app it self should either be:
  - using one of the sensors of your mobile phone such as the camera, accelerometer or voice assistance etc. 
  - using an external API to fetch something to your app and then interact with it.
  - a multiscreen app by using [React Navigation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation).
 
## What I learned 🧠

- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practice using Styled Components for your styling.
- Practice to work with API's

## How I got started 💪🏼

I forked a repo, cloneed it into my projects folder on my computer and
opened up VS Code.
In the terminal, I ran `npm install` to install the dependencies needed
I ran the react native development server by running `npm start` or `expo start`
I made sure that I signed up to expo.io and downloaded the app to my phone.
I scanned the QR code to open upp the app on my phone and made sure that my phone 
and your computer was connected to the same network.

I decided almost immediately that i wantet to display inspiring photos from Pexels 
and also show the photographers name. If there was time I also wanted to be able to 
share a photo. 

## Requirements 🧪

- You should use Styled Components.
