# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week we worked in React Native to build an app. The assignment was quite open but we needed to choose one focus area. I chose to focus on API and mnultible screens.

I used the Rijksmuseum in Amsteradams API to build an app which shows four of my favorite artists from the Dutch Golden age in the 17th century.

## The problem

The challenge in this project was to understand how React and React Native is both similar but different. React Native comes with much more ready made components. Which is awsome but also a bit challenging to work around.

Had I had more time I would have liked to build one resuable component instead of one for each artist. But time ran out to figure that one out.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
