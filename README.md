# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week's project was about creating our first mobileapp using React Native.

## The problem

I started with creating two pages, Homescreen and FrogScreen and used styled components to style text, background etc. Then with the help of navigatorContainer I created multiple screens and to be able to navigate between the screens. I used accelerometer and react-native-gesture-handler in order to create the accelorometer and to be able to shake the phone in order to move image.  Tools used were React Native, Expo, Navigator,react-native-gesture-handler and styled components. If I had more time I would have done some animations and styled the app better or done a completely different app like a game.
