# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Aim: building my firts mobile app using React Native!

## The problem

I decided to use to seperate API:s to display random info, based on that i created one component with shakesensor and one where i applied a sharefunction. I then added the navigationbar to navigate between the api-components. If i would have had more time i would have worked more on the styling and also fintuned the accelerometer a bit more.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
