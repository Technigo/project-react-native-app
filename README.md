# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project was part of Technigo Bootcamp and this week the assignment was to create our first app using React Native.

We had a pretty open brief but was supposed to include either sensor, navigation or API or a combination of these.

## The problem

I struggled a bit this week due to less time than normal and lots of new information and syntax. I initially created a weather app using an API an included navigation. However, I didn't get it to work as I hoped and I wasn't happy with it at all so I decided to completely change path and create a movie app using the API from our movie site project a few weeks back.

I included a basic start page which has 3 lists of movies and when clicked in you get that endpoint from the API. When you click on a film you will come to a detail page about that movie.

If I had more time I would include a search function and perhaps a share function.
