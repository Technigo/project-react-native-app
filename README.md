# Project Random Pokémon app in React Native

This is a React Native app that uses Pokéapi to display random pokémon.

## Tech and techniques
- React Native
- JavaScript
- Styled components

## What did I do?

In this project I started with looking at the data I could get from Pokéapi. After that I tested fetching data from the API.

I used styled components to build the app.

If I had more time I would try to add more info about the randomly selected Pokémon, e.g. what type it is and which types it's effective or weak against.
