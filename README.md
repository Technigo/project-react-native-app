# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
I am building a simple Stop Watch App using React Native and Styled components.

## The problem

The logics seems to be more complex than i thought. I learned the way nested If statements work inside UseEffect hook. Also, the ScrollView and Styled components are new things to me.
I did not have much time working on this project so I surely can improve a lot in the styling, structuring the App into different components instead of having all codes in only one big App like now.

I copied some parts of the codes from google and it works. Not really sure, I can repeate them myself.
