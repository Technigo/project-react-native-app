# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project was made during Technigo Bootcamp. 
It's my first React Native App and i've decided to create a multiscreen app
where you can shuffle challenges!


## The Project

I got inspired by a book i am reading that is called "nice girls don't get the corner office", author - Lois P.Frankel. 
Because in the book you get a lot of tips on how you can boost your career by practicing
different tasks which i decided to create as challenges. 

I started with creating a skiss for my project and during that process i decided to go for multipage app using React Navigation. 
The home page has a small intro text and animation from Lottie. And the second screen called Challenges is a page where you can shuffle through different challenges by pressing a button!

Currently the challenges are a simple array that i have created and the next step would be to create my own API and fetch the challenges.
