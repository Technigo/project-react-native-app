# Popular Movies React Native App ðŸ“±

This app is a React Native take on a previous project I did that displays popular movies and let's you get more detailed info when you click on them.

## The problem

I started with looking at the structure of my previous project and decided which parts I was going to redo for this project.
To make sure everything would work I built it one component at at time and used styled components to style it.
Instead of doing a details page I went for an alert box that appears when a movie is pressed (using TouchableOpacity), and it displays the title, overview and the rating.

Tech used: React, React Native, Styled Components, hooks, API's
