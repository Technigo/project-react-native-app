# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I built an app in React Native. I found a cute API that show random images of dogs, and made a button that shows an image everytime you press it. 

## The problem

I had problems to make everything work in the beginning and to get a grasp of how React Native and Styled Components works. I also struggled a bit with making the fetch from the API to show as an image instead of the image-url.
