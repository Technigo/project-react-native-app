# Project 13 - Build a React Native App 📱

In this week's project we we're supposed to build our first mobile application with React Native! I went for a silly budget app to get familiar with React Native and also could practise more on how to work with useState and adding user inputs to arrays.

You can try out my app here (Chrome is recommended for sneakpeak in web, scan QR Code to open in iOS/Android device): <br>
