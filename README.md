# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This weeks project was to build an app using react native and styled components. 

## The problem

I tried to keep it really simple this week by picking an api to use, then used some styled components and implemented that. i chose to use the accelerometer in the device as the speciality for the project. I had difficulties finding an api that worked, but found one in the end.
