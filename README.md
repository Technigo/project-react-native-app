# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week was an introduction to React Native and I created a mobile app that fetch random activities to do. 

## The problem
This week was really fun and it was interesting exploring React Native. I decided to go with the API as focus area in the end, so my mobile app fetches random activites so if you are bored you can press a button and get examples on activities. 

But at the begining I wanted to do a step counter, but I didn't managed to get the pedometer to work on my phone (android). So in the end I changed focus area, but if I had more time this week I would liked to try the step counter again and combining those two focus areas to the project.
