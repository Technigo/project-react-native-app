# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I have created my first mobile app with React Native. I choose the focus area sensors.
The app I have created gives you amazing facts about cats when you shake your phone. 

## The problem

I would say the biggest problem this week were installing all the dependencies. Other than thouse difficulties I had a lot of fun. I think app development might be something I'll want to look into more in the future.
