# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The assignment this week was to make an app with React Native, I chose to use the sensors and created a compass with it 

## The problem

I went head first, I quickly noticed that React & React Native are quite similar so the logic & structure were easy to make.
It was fun to learn YET another language.
