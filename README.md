# Project React Native App 📱

The goal was to build a mobile app using react-native using styled components. 

## The problem

We learnt how to use React Native to create a mobile app and practiced using Styled Components for styling. I chose to experiment using an API fetch with useEffect to display random images. I used refreshControl to enable a new image reload when the user swipes down and focused on testing for Android devices.
