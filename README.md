# Production Process

- I started by planning the functionalities and layout for the project and dividing those into components.

- After searching for an API, I ended up chosing 2 that provided with random quotes (one about movies and the other about programming). I decided to generate them by clicking a button.

- Created a stack navigator containing 3 different pages (Home, Movie Quote and Programmer Quote)
