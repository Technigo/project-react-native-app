# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project we have built our first mobile application with React Native!
It was a free project with free design, only restrictions was that it should be a mobile app created with React Native and using styled components.

I made a simple To-do List where you can "check"-completed tasks and delete tasks. If you try to add a to-do without any text, the phone will vibrate.

Here you can find it in Snack:
