Description:

React native app that shows pictures of cute dogs when you push the screen,

What did I do? 

I used expo/vs code and fetched a dog-API onto React Native to create a mobile app. I also used Styled Components for the styling.

If I had more time I wanted to fetch and diplay each dogs temperament.
