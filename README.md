# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

App built with React Native

## The problem

I chose to make an app which fetches image and information about space and presents it with image and title. More info about the picture is shown in a textbox that is shown when clicking a button. Another button shows a new image with info.
Added a share-function but didnÂ´t manage to make it work. I think itÂ´s because I have mapped the fetched information. If I had more time I would have tried another approach.
I chose to style with CSS in Js.
