# Project React Native App

Built a react native application to search for cocktails by their name on the home screen, display a list of 
alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks on another screen, and integrated a shake sensor to display random drinks
when the user shakes their phone. 

## The problem

First, I fetched the data from the cocktail api to display all drinks. Then integrated the shake sensor with
Accelerometer from expo-sensors. Lastly, I created a navigation containing three different screens to display
different information and styled the application with react native styled components.
