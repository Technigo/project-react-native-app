# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The assignment was to create a mobile app with React Native and styled components. The app should be multiscreen by using React Navigation and using an external API to fetch something and interact with it.

## The problem

I started with a outlining the navigation views and finding an API to work with. I chose to make a Quote-machine with one of the most quoted authors - Oscar Wilde. To interact with the API I first wanted to use the accelerometer sensor to shake for new quotes. Setting up the software for development took more time than anticipated, so I used a button instead. When reaching the API requests limit for quotes, I implemented a page that tells you to come back tomorrow for more quotes.
