# Project 13 - Build a React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project we we're supposed to build our first mobile application with React Native! I went for a silly budget app to get familiar with React Native and also could practise more on how to work with useState and adding user inputs to arrays.

You can take a try out my app here: https://snack.expo.io/@nyblad/budget-app
