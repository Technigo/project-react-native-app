# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

First try in learning react native. 
Combined a nav-bar with fetch from 3 APIÂ´s


## The problem

Had a problem to get it all up and running.
I still cant connect to expo on my mobile.

If it would have worked better with all the technical connections I would have had some more time to experiment with more interaction and to acctually make the app work in Expo mobile.

## View it live

Cant get it to work on Netlify unfortunately.
