# Project React Native App - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.

This is my first mobile application using React Native and Styled Components!


Learning Objectives:
- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practice using Styled Components for your styling.

## Approach
This React Native App project was one steep learning curve! I had to take my current knowledge of React and then recontextulize it within React Native's constraints. On top of this, I was also playing with some new tools: Expo, the accelerometer on my mobile device, and and API that was new to me-- so lots of new concepts to figure out and implement. 

After deciding on building and Animal Crossing villager randomizer and working out how that might function on paper, I set to work. I quickly realized I had to work backwards in order to test while coding, for example:
    - the API fetch had work before trying to randomize that data.
    - The random loading fucntion had to work before working out how to connect it to the sensor.
I had trouble accesing specific data points in from the API array so I pulled a handful of villagers (and their relevant data points) into a smaller and locally stored array. I also created a button for any development testing that needed to happen before getting to the step of pulling in the accelerometer component. 

This project was not easy, but it was a fun challenge that was made manageable by breaking down my goals into smaller functional chunks. Then I kept building on the chunks that I had to end up with a finished project. Neat!


## Core Tech
- API
- React Native
- React Hooks
- Styled Components


## Requirements Completed
ðŸ”µ  Blue Level
- You should use Styled Components.
- The app should either be:
    - using one of the sensors of your mobile phone such as the camera, accelerometer or voice assistance etc.
    - using an external API to fetch something to your app and then interact with it.
    <!-- - a multiscreen app by usingÂ React Navigation. -->
    <!-- - a useful app such as a calculator, a stopwatch or a compass. -->

<!-- ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals) -->
<!-- - Implement some animations â†’ either have a look at panResponders or take a look at how to implement animations with the help of [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/) -->

<!-- âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)
- Multiple screens â†’ add some kind of navigation in your app, either with bottom tabs or navigation backwards and forwards between screens. -->
