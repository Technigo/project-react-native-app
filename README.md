# Project React Native App üì±

This was a @Technigo week 16 project consisting of building an app with React-Native using either sensors, fetching data from an API or navigation. I built a Pok√©mon app fetching a random pokemon when shaking the phone.

## The problem

I chose to go for the API fetch and the accelerator sensor primarily. I studied the API that I've chose to come up with a way to fetch a random Pok√©mon and used Math.random() to generate it. I decided to implement Redux from the beginning since I like working with a global storage and I knew I wanted to be able to store Pok√©mons later on but I didn't know long every thing would take to develop. What I'm turning in this week is an app fetching random Pok√©mons and with a tweaked randomizer so that it more often returns Pok√©mons with an id lower than 251 so that the other less known Pok√©mons is rare to get.

In my repository there will be a lot of commented out code because some functions are still in progress. I've developed a function to store up to six Pok√©mons in your team, remove Pok√©mons from team and drawer navigation to navigate between the shake fetch page and the team page, and they are done I would say, but I'm also trying to implement redux-persist and AsyncStorage so that the users team of Pok√©mons won't disappear in between using sessions and it's not working just yet. When it does all the functions will be available :D

For the future it would be cool to develop some kind of game to be played and won if the user wants to catch a Pok√©mon in order to add it to their team.
