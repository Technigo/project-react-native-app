Description:

React native app that shows random pictures of cute dogs along with information about their breeds and name when you push the screen,

What did I do? 

I used expo/vs code and fetched a dog-API. The Api didnt contain breeds and temperament info for all the dogs so I sat up an if statment telling the fetch to only fetch dog-pictures with this type of information. Then I usen react native to create a mobile app that works for both Android and IOS. I also used Styled Components for the styling.

If I had more time I wanted to add a share function.
