# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I've created my first app in React Native. I chose the focus area API:s where the user is able to fetch data from a dog API to show different dog breeds and their characters.

## The problem

I got stuck a few times this week, especially when it come to styling in React Native. The syntax is also different and many new things to learn. I discussed my problems during Townhall, with my team and wrote questions in Stack Overflow. A special thanks to Ida and Rawi who helped me alot!

## View it live

Here is the app without animations (not compatible with browser in React Native, only in mobile)
