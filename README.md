# Project React Native App üì±

Mission was to build our first mobile app with React Native.

## The problem

### Actually this week was a total mess for me, but also sort of "fun"! üòÇ

1. Did some tests in Expo first, all went good. 

2. Then I made a wire frame design in Whimsical with my idea: a bar code scanner. After that I started following some great guides and coded in VS code but got totally stuck around "cocoa pods and Xcode" in combination with not compatible Xcode ver and SDK. Well, I learnt all about Xcode and macOS sys versions this way and also got a new idea about making a app showing this information to help others. But my project was still stuck after hours spend on google, installations and desperately trying to get it to work. 

3. So I switched to do a "Image picker" in Expo. It all went perfectly. Then I tried to do the same project in VS code. And got stuck. After a more hours trying I understand that it is a difference in Expo SDK 35 and 37 regarding the permission issue in iOS. Our forked project is in 35 and Expo didn't recommend switching SDK in a project:
‚Äù..upgrading your projects Expo SDK version can be difficult because of the amount of breaking changes and deprecations in each upgrade."
OMG..üòÖ
So I was back again and had nothing. ü§Ø

4. Desperately I then started to follow Jennies code along for the "Houses" but now my project was probably a mess. Navigation and Stack just crash everything. I also tested some things with change package.json and reinstall dependencies but nothing worked. I rolled back to what I had and did some more styling, tested using external gif, lottie's and more.

Bad week as I did not manage to get done what I intended to do. But ok week as I needed to search for info, test things and learnt reading doc. 
I also have lot's of ideas to be built in the future. üåª


## View it live

I didn't know how to deploy or export this. Found some info about publsihing to Netlify and using Amplify but I leave that for now. (Don't want to mess things upp so I will probably make a new project and test things like publishing.) 

My first idea on Whimsical - the thing I intended to build:
