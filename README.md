# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Build a simple mobile appliciation with React-native. 

## The problem

It has been a struggle to understand react-native framework which was different from react library. The main learnings
  - divide components into re-usable elements
  - implement diverse react-native APIs
  - experiment with sensor methods (which was really fun!)

Things that I need to study more: 
- using styled component with react-native components, syntax is not clear
- be responsive portrait & landscape screen
- control default components (button, alert, nav style - can I modify it or is it better to follow OS standard?)
- understand mobile screen resolution
