# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.
I created my own multipage exercise-app for horseback-riders. In the app the user could, depending on what type of training they would like, randomize different exercises within dressage or jumping. 

The app was built in React Native and was published in Expo. The learning objectives were to learn how to use React Native to create a mobile App and to practice using Styled Components for styling in JavaScript.

## The problem 

The biggest challenges facing this week were to get Expo to work properly.
