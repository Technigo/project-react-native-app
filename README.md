# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project is a mobile app built with React Native, making use of styled components. The app is Kanye West Quote-Generator. The app fetches an api with Kanye West quote for the user to interact with. New quotes are generated on pull-down of screen. The app is tested on an iPhone X.

For this project I have explored:

- React Native
- React Native documents
- Styled components
- expo & expo snacks
- various React Native components such as ScrollView, RefreshControl, SafeAreaView and Alert. 

## The problem ðŸ§ 

I started with reading the brief closely to make sure I understood what the goal and requirements were for this project. I then did some research on react native and basic apps to build. After that I sketched a design and user-flow. After that, I did some more research into how to work with api:s in React Native. 

Then I stared to code - I had an idea on what was needed to achieve my goal. I came quite far before I ran into a dead-end. At this time I turned to googleing and to reach out to get help. I did get help and that help pointed me in several directions and I ended up with a code that was built from bits and pieces from all over. Not ideal. And still warnings and errors being thrown. Eventually I was helped with scaling down my code and making it a lot cleaner than I had done. 

## Main learning this week ðŸ’œ
It was tricky to take my knowledge of js, css, and html and put it to use in React Native. I had lots of warnings and errors along the way. Also building for different devices was hard. But I also really enjoyed it. There is something very satisfying in viewing and interacting with your results on a mobile. I can definitely see myself learning more about React Native - and having fun doing it.

I also need to become more structured and methodological when debugging - both to same time and sanity ðŸ˜€.
