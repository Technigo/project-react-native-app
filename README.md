# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This project assignment was to build a mobile application with React Native, using styled components and a chosen focus areas.

I chose the focus area of sensors and the accelerometer. I made an app with a magic 8-ball, that shows different answers after shaking the phone. The code is split up into four different components. The sensor-component detects movement of the phone and stores a randomized answer from an array in the state. A different design is shown when shaking the phone. 

I had some problems in the beginning getting expo to work, so a lot of time was spent on that and the app is therefore quite simple. If I had had more time I would have made an animation when the phone is shaken. Maybe also a third view that is shown as a start-screen so an answer isn't shown before the phone is shaken.

The layout looks best on an iPhone 6/7/8.
