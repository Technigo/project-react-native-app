# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

A React Native mobile application fetching and displaying dad jokes from an API, where you can generate new random jokes, search for jokes and share jokes with your friends.

Built during Technigo Boot Camp fall 2020, week 13 out of 24.

## The problem

I started looking up fun free API's and found a straight-forward API to work with. The main idea was to randomly display something from an API, and then have a button to generate a new random whatever, which ended up to be a joke in this case. After elaborating around what I could do with the data and API endpoints, I implemented some interaction to the application - a search field and share function.

As a next step I would break out the components to separate files, have a TouchableOpacity component instead of a Button component and use props to style them differenly, and use the Alert component to customize the alert messages.
