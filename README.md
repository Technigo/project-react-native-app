# Project React Native App - Wildlife photos 📱

This week I built my first mobile application with React Native!

It is a mobile app created with React Native and using styled components. Also, the app it self uses an external API from Pexels to fetch photos to my app and then you can interact with it. Read more about the photographer and share photos with family and friens.

  
## What I learned 🧠

- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practice using Styled Components for your styling.
- Practice to work with API's

## How I got started 💪🏼

I forked a repo, cloneed it into my projects folder on my computer and
opened up VS Code.
In the terminal, I ran `npm install` to install the dependencies needed
I ran the react native development server by running `npm start` or `expo start`
I made sure that I signed up to expo.io and downloaded the app to my phone.
I scanned the QR code to open upp the app on my phone and made sure that my phone 
and your computer was connected to the same network.

I decided almost immediately that i wantet to display inspiring photos from Pexels 
and also show the photographers name. If there was time I also wanted to be able to 
share a photo. 

## Requirements 🧪

- use Styled Components.
