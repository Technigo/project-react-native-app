# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This was the first project I made with React Native.

## The problem

The goal was to see how it is to work with React Native and Expo and how it differs from React. I made just a simple Magic Eightball app where you engage the phone's sensors by shaking it. I also learned to use styled components for this project.
