# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

An app build with React Native wich shows a mantra a day. The mantras are fetched from an API. 

## The problem/ Approach

I've had this app in mind for a quite some time, so I kinda had the plan already made in my mind. A hard part was to find a good API and that took some time (still not very satisfied) 
Another thing that was super hard was to grasp React Native... The thousands of different components and all the new ways of writing code. Its so similiar and at the same time totally different. Hard!
