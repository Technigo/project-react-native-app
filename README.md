# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

A mobile app created with React Native. The app fetches data from two different API (TMDB api and a activity randomiser) and generates and displays a suggestion for each of them.

## Features

- Using react components
- Use of React Native
- Use of useState and useEffect hooks
- Use of React Navigator drawer to navigate between different screens
- styled components
- Use of React native shake sensor on mobile device

## Production process

Started planning by choosing the APIs to work with. Started the process by setting up the fetching of the Movie API and the be able to get the data to display and for the shake sensor connected to react to the movement and fetch a new randomly choosen movie. Since I had a few issues with the movie API I set up a activity generator as a backup. The issue with hte movie API was solved with a filter function in the fetch response. I instead ended up using both APIs and put them in a navigation drawer. Added a start screen and finished the project by styling it.
