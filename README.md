# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Hello! I'm your new personal book-shopping helper!
Use me to scan ISBN and buy the book only at cheaper price! 
Also, some of the books will come from a very big book marketplace and local bookstores can benefit from that too! :)

## Note
I have another version of this app using openlibrary API. The only limit is that they only have English books!
To make the scanning smooth in this app, I remove the api for now.
However, if you're curious about the Openlibrary API (which unfortunately has limited data on non-English books), here is my codesandbox to show you how I fetched the data

I have learned so much from this little side track trying to manage Object.keys.
Thank you Technigo and FrontendMentor community for helping me get the data I want from this API which was not easy at all for my level.
I have learned a lot!!!
