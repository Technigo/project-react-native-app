# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week I am really push the boundaries with React and use React Native to build real native mobile apps. YAY! It's pretty similar to React but not entirely, for example you can't use CSS in React Native, but I used Styled Components as I chose to.

## Focus Area: Sensors
I am creating an app which fetches quotes from a beloved American TV series 'The Office'. It updates a quote whenever an user shakes the phone.
On mobile, we have a lot of sensors available  to us that we can make use of in react native. I am therefore using the Accelerometer function to trigger the fetch from public API for The Office Quote Generator. The part I had most fun with was to go back and forth with fetching and hard coding for each variables I needed to connect the api point with.
This was a nice chance to find out that I have so much more fun developing with React Native, even more so than I was dealing with only vanilla javaScript!

## The problem

## Focus Area: APIs & Sharing
Similar to how we've been coding in React, I had a chance to build an app which fetches some information and displays it to the user in a nice way.  
The main purpose of pursuing this focus-area was to explore the differences between React Native and React for web.
