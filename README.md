# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Week 13 at Technigo Bootcamp

The restrictions for this week was to create a mobile app with React Native, by using styled components and either use:

â€“ One the sensors from the mobile phone (such as the camera, accelerometer or voice assistance)

â€“ An external API to fetch something to the app and interact with it.

â€“ A multiscreen app by using React Navigation.

â€“ A useful app. 

## The problem

I choosed to create an app that uses the accelerometer sensor from the mobile phone and created a minimalistic step counter, which also contains suggestions of how to gain more steps. I learned how to use React Native to create a mobile app, how to install and import packages like expo-sensors for the Pedometer which I used, and how to use styled components.
