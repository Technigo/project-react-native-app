# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

My daughter has start to explore letters and is learning new ones all the time. I have made a simple app that she can use. She is 3 years old.
I made a json with letters and emoji and then I have created a component that randomizes letters, and when you click the button it vibrates so she gets an instant response.
If i had more time, I would make one more page with words instead of letters before. And as a bonus add an animation.
