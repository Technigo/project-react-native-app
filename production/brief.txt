Project React Native App

In this week's project, you'll be building your first mobile application with React Native!


***It's time for your creative juices to flow like the Niagara Falls!***

This week's project is a very free one. Your only restrictions are that it should be a mobile app created with React Native and using styled components. Also, the app it self should either be:

- using one of the sensors of your mobile phone such as the camera, accelerometer or voice assistance etc.
- using an external API to fetch something to your app and then interact with it.
- a multiscreen app by using [React Navigation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation).
- a useful app such as a calculator, a stopwatch or a compass.

## Ideas that you could build 💡**

- step counter
- magic 8 ball
- some kind of game based on shakes/tilts on the phone
- photo booth
- a bubble level
- Or maybe you remember [this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT9gxQkSCN8&feature=youtu.be)!?
- Fetch a bunch of cute dog photos from an API and use the [share method](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/share) to share it with your friends.

***Or ask Technigo alumni for fun ideas that they built or came across***

## What you will learn 🧠

- How to use React Native to create a mobile app
- Practice using Styled Components for your styling.

## How to get started 💪🏼

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone this repo into your projects folder on your computer
3. Open up VS Code
4. In the terminal, run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed
5. Run the react native development server by running `npm start` or `expo start`
6. Make sure that you have signed up to expo.io and downloaded the app to your phone.
7. Scan the QR code to open upp the app on your phone. Make sure that your phone and your computer is connected to the same network.

## **Hints and tips to complete the project 🤓**

Start by investigating the React Native documentation and see what components there are and what else you can do in React Native such as making the phone [vibrate](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/vibration), copy something to [clipboard](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/clipboard), use [popup alerts](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/alert).

Once you have your idea, start by sketching out what your app will look like and how you'd like to use components. Now we're using styled components, but you can still break things into small, manageable components.

After that, think about how the logic should be divided up. Are you using an API? What component should handle the fetch. Are you building a compass, how should you structure you files?

Then you're ready to start working on the project. This project has a base of what you need to get started, but if you want to use some extra libraries or packapages, such as React Navigation, you need to install it like this:

```
npm install --save react-navigation

```

When starting to write your code, try to work on the project in small chunks rather than taking on too much at once.

## **How to hand in the code 🎯**

- When you’re finished with the project, push your code to GitHub with these commands:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "your commit message"
    git push origin master

    ```

- Navigate to your repo and create a Pull Request into the Technigo repo
- Wait for the code review from your teachers

Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting with the intermediary and advanced goals.

**🔴 Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- Implement some animations → either have a look at panResponders or take a look at how to implement animations with the help of [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/)

**⚫ Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- Multiple screens → add some kind of navigation in your app, either with bottom tabs or navigation backwards and forwards between screens.

🚨 Don't forget to add, commit and push the changes to GitHub when you're done. 🏁
